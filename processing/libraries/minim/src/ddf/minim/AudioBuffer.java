/**
 * An <code>AudioBuffer</code> is specifically a buffer of floating point samples 
 * corresponding to a single channel of streaming audio. It is readonly, but you 
 * can obtain a copy of the samples in the buffer by using {@link #toArray()}. In 
 * fact, when drawing a waveform, you should use <code>toArray</code> rather than 
 * iterating over the buffer itself. This is because it is possible that the samples 
 * in the buffer will be replaced with new ones between calls to {@link #get(int)}, 
 * which results in a waveform that appears to have discontinuities in it.
