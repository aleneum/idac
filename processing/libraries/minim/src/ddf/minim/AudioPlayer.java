 * An <code>AudioPlayer</code> is used for playing an
 * <code>AudioRecording</code>. Strictly speaking, you don't need an
 * <code>AudioPlayer</code> to play an <code>AudioRecording</code>, because
 * the recording is itself <code>Playable</code>. However, an
 * <code>AudioPlayer</code> does you the favor of providing
 * <code>AudioBuffer</code>s that are sync'd with the recording's output as
 * well as providing direct control over the <code>DataLine</code> being used
 * to transmit the recording to the system. You can get an
 * <code>AudioPlayer</code> by calling {@link Minim#loadFile(String)}, but
 * you can also construct one yourself if you've written your own implementation
 * of <code>AudioRecording</code>.
